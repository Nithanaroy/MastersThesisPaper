\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
{\grp} combines social and spatial searches which work on any geosocial graph. Different tunable parameters give an extra layer of flexibility to such a generic solution. Thorough experiments not only prove this point by outperforming existing approaches by at least 3 times even in extreme cases but also show how to set each of the tunable arguments. Extensions to {\grp} can include a persistent way to store the index and also a distributed {\grp} algorithm.
