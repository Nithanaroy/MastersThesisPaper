{\bf GeoSocial Graph Data.} Is a weighted directed graph $G=(V,E,S)$ consisting of (1) a set of vertices $V$; (2) a set of directed edges, $E\subset V\times V$ with weights, which represent relationship strengths. If $(u,v)\in E$, there exists one edge from vertex $u$ to $v$; (3) a function $S$ defined on $V$ that decides spatial attribute of a given vertex. $S(v)$ returns spatial property of $v$ (denoted as $v.spatial$), generally for venues, and the value will be null when $v$ brings no spatial attribute, generally for people. $S(v)$ can be a geometrical a point, line, or polygon. For ease of presentation, we assume that a spatial attribute of spatial vertex is represented by a point.

\textbf{Path.} A path is a sequence of vertices and edges that are distinct from one another. A path is denoted as $p =$ ($v_1$, $e_1$,..., $v_{n-1}$, $e_{n-1}$, $v_n$) where $v_i\neq v_j~and~e_i\neq e_j (i\neq j)$. Length of $p$ is denoted as $L(p) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n-1}w(e_i)$. This path starts from vertex $v_1$ to $v_n$. 

\textbf{Shortest Path or Socially closest.} In $G$, there can be multiple paths between two vertices $u$ and $v$. $Paths(u,v) = \{p|p = (u,e_1,..., v)\}$ is to represent the set of all paths that start from $u$ and end at $v$. Shortest path between $u$ and $v$ is a path that has the shortest $L(p)$ where $p\in Paths(u,v)$, denoted as $ShortestPath(u,v)$. As we are in a geospatial graph world, shortest path between two people nodes is an objective way to indicate the strength of their relationship. Similarly shortest path between a person node and a spatial node (generally a venue) is a numerical way to represent the person's preference strength of that venue.

\textbf{Shortest path between vertex and spatial region.} Given a vertex $v$ and a spatial region $R$, there exist many shortest paths from $v$ to $U$, where $U$ is the set of all vertices in $R$. RangeReachPaths($G$, $v$, $R$, $K$) returns $K$ shortest paths among all shortest paths 

\begin{eqnarray*}
  	(P_1..P_K) \ni P_i = ShortestPath(v, u_i) | u_i \in U\ and\\
  	P_i(v, u_i) \neq P_j(v, u_j) \leftrightarrow u_i \neq u_j
\end{eqnarray*}

Given a graph $G(V, E)$ where,

\quad$V \rightarrow set\ of\ vertices$

\quad$E \rightarrow set\ of\ edges$

$Vs \subset V$ have spatial attributes; i.e. $\forall v \in Vs \Leftrightarrow v.spatial$ attribute exists\\


\textbf{RangeReachPaths S(G, v, R, K):} an ordered list of K shortest paths starting from v that reach a region R in graph G, where R is a spatial range predicate. Let's abbreviate this as {\rrp}(G, v, R, K).

\textbf{Path, P(u, w):} A set of vertices along the way from u to w \(\Rightarrow w\ is\ reachable\ from\ u\)

\quad${P(u, w) \in S(v, R) \Leftrightarrow}$

\quad\quad{u = v and}

\quad\quad${w \in Vs}$ and

\quad\quad{w.spatial lies in region R}\\

See Figure \ref{fig:begin-example} to understand the problem better. Let `Bob' be the source vertex, v and R be the region of interest. A, B, ... K vertices have spatial attributes like latitude and longitude information. \{A, B, C, D, E, J\} vertices fall outside the region and so are not returned by {\rrp}. Vertex K falls inside R but cannot be reached from v, so are not returned by {\rrp}. \{F, H, G, I\} vertices satisfy both these conditions as they fall inside the region and are also reachable from v. Therefore, {\rrp} may return shortest paths to them. These paths with rich social information about the relationship with v, can be fed into a recommendation system which can rank them. \textit{RangeReachPaths in a geospatial graph produces K venues in a region ranked by the social distances to the source vertex.}
